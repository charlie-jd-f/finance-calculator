After my first project for HyperionDev, I was taked with creating a finance calculator.
This program worked fine, however it was a command-line application.
To demonstrate new learning, I have redone this, now adding a GUI interface.

Markup: * app.py - this contains the code to run the file
        * my.kv - this contains the design features of the GUI
        * logo.png - this is a logo for the fictional company
        * financial_calcutions - this contains the functions required to find investment return and bond costs
